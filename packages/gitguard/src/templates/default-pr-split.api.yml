  Analyze these changes and suggest how to split them into multiple PRs. Focus on main feature groups and aim for 2-3 PRs maximum. If changes are cohesive and logical together, suggest keeping them as a single PR.

  Base Branch: {{baseBranch}}

  Commits:
  {{#each commits}}
  - {{this.hash}}: {{this.message}}
  {{/each}}

  Files Changed:
  {{#each files}}
  - {{this.path}} (+{{this.additions}} -{{this.deletions}})
  {{/each}}

  {{#if diff}}
  Key Changes:
  ```diff
  {{diff}}
  ```
  {{/if}}

  Please provide split suggestions in this JSON format:
  {
    "reason": "explanation why the changes should be split (or why they should stay together)",
    "suggestedPRs": [
      {
        "title": "descriptive PR title",
        "description": "detailed description of changes",
        "files": ["list", "of", "files"],
        "order": 1,
        "baseBranch": "branch to base PR on",
        "dependencies": ["list of PR numbers this depends on"]
      }
    ] | [], // Empty array if no split needed
    "commands": ["git commands to execute the split"]
  }

  Guidelines:
  1. Focus on main feature groups - aim for 2-3 PRs maximum
  2. Keep related changes together (features + tests + types + styles)
  3. Only split when changes serve different business purposes
  4. Consider deployment dependencies
  5. Follow conventional commit format for titles
  6. Include clear git commands for implementation

  Keep as single PR when:
  1. Changes implement a single feature or fix
  2. Changes are tightly coupled or interdependent
  3. Small to medium-sized changes across related areas
  4. Infrastructure changes that need to be deployed together

  Remember: Return empty suggestedPRs array if changes are cohesive and shouldn't be split!
