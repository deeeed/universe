WIP:

- document explaining some of the key reasons for building gitguard

I have seen the way I code change incredibly in the last year, and it seems to keep increasing as AI models improve.
I need to find a way to be the most efficient leveraging these models without breaking existing codes or the bank.

New feature to maintain api consistency and integrity.
The problem with new development with code being generated by AI is that it's not always consistent with the existing codebase.
This feature will help to maintain the consistency and integrity of the codebase by suggesting changes to the commit message and split.
We also need to be able to track breaking changes and other issues in the codebase.
