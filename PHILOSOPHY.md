# Philosophy Behind @siteed/universe

## Vision
As a builder and hacker at heart, I believe in creating tools that make development more efficient and enjoyable. This monorepo represents my commitment to open-source development and serves as the foundation for all my projects, from experimental prototypes to production applications.

## Core Principles

### 1. Build to Learn, Share to Grow
- Every package started as a learning tool
- Documentation and examples are first-class citizens
- Share knowledge through practical, reusable implementations

### 2. Cross-Platform by Default
- Mobile-first but platform-agnostic
- Consistent experience across iOS, Android, and Web
- Leverage Expo for rapid prototyping and deployment

### 3. Developer Experience First
- Type-safe by default with TypeScript
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Automated workflows for common tasks
- Strong testing and validation

### 4. Modular and Maintainable
- Each package solves one problem well
- Clear boundaries between packages
- Consistent patterns across all packages

## Current Focus
This monorepo contains my essential developer toolkit, representing a subset of tools I've developed over the years:

- **@siteed/design-system**: A cross-platform UI component library
- **@siteed/react-native-logger**: Advanced logging for mobile apps
- **@siteed/publisher**: Streamlined monorepo release management
- **@siteed/gitguard**: AI-powered commit quality tools

While these packages are actively used in my daily projects, they represent just the beginning. I have numerous other tools and libraries developed over my career that will be gradually integrated, refined, and open-sourced here.

## Goals

### Short-term
1. Improve documentation and examples
2. Create video tutorials and blog posts
3. Integrate existing projects into the monorepo structure
4. Establish consistent quality standards across all packages
5. Share development insights through siteed.net

### Long-term
1. Expand to hardware/software integration tools
2. Add AI-powered development utilities
3. Create comprehensive project templates
4. Build a ecosystem of compatible tools

## Building in Public
I believe in continuous improvement and learning in public. While these packages are still in their early stages and actively being refined, they represent real solutions I'm developing for common challenges I face in my projects. By developing in public, I:

- Hold myself accountable for maintaining high code quality
- Create opportunities for community feedback and collaboration
- Share my development journey and learning process
- Document the evolution from prototype to production-ready tools

As these packages mature and prove themselves in real-world applications, they may evolve into their own dedicated repositories. This approach allows for transparent iteration and improvement while working towards battle-tested, production-grade solutions.

## Contributing
While these tools are primarily built for my own needs, I welcome contributions that align with the core principles above.
