# Philosophy Behind @siteed/universe

## Vision
As a builder and hacker at heart, I believe in creating tools that make development more efficient and enjoyable. This monorepo represents my commitment to open-source development and serves as the foundation for all my projects, from experimental prototypes to production applications.

## Core Principles

### 1. Build to Learn, Share to Grow
- Every package started as a learning tool
- Documentation and examples are first-class citizens
- Share knowledge through practical, reusable implementations

### 2. Cross-Platform by Default
- Mobile-first but platform-agnostic
- Consistent experience across iOS, Android, and Web
- Leverage Expo for rapid prototyping and deployment

### 3. Developer Experience First
- Type-safe by default with TypeScript
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Automated workflows for common tasks
- Strong testing and validation

### 4. Modular and Maintainable
- Each package solves one problem well
- Clear boundaries between packages
- Consistent patterns across all packages

## Current Focus
This monorepo contains my essential developer toolkit:

- **@siteed/design-system**: A cross-platform UI component library
- **@siteed/react-native-logger**: Advanced logging for mobile apps
- **@siteed/publisher**: Streamlined monorepo release management
- **@siteed/gitguard**: AI-powered commit quality tools

## Goals

### Short-term
1. Improve documentation and examples
2. Add more test coverage
3. Create video tutorials and blog posts
4. Build a community of contributors

### Long-term
1. Expand to hardware/software integration tools
2. Add AI-powered development utilities
3. Create comprehensive project templates
4. Build a ecosystem of compatible tools

## Contributing
This project is my way of giving back to the developer community. While these tools are primarily built for my own needs, I welcome contributions that align with the core principles above.
