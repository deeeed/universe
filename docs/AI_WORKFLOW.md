Please guide me into definining the specifications to "add a new feature"

While writing the detailed steps, please consider the following:
-  the detailed steps should be written in a way that is easy to understand and follow for an AI model
-  minimize breaking changes
-  always prefer object parameters over primitive parameters. we want the code to be easily extensible
